Description: You can develop and run Python Dash apps using RStudio Cloud; this 
  is a handy way of teaching/demonstrating Dash in Python without having to fuss
  over Python environments. The point of this package is to make it easier to 
  launch Dash apps to run on *your* browser, if Dash is running on RStudio Cloud
  or RStudio Server.
